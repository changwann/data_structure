Specifically, the quick find implementation will always spend O(n) time on the union operation and in the quick union implementation, it is possible for all the vertices to form a line after connecting them using union, which results in the worst-case scenario for the find function. Is there any way to optimize these implementations?\n","\n","Of course, there is; it is to union by rank. The word “rank” means ordering by specific criteria. Previously, for the union function, we always chose the root node of x and set it as the new root node for the other vertex. However, by choosing the parent node based on certain criteria (by rank), we can limit the maximum height of each vertex.\n","\n","To be specific, the “rank” refers to the height of each vertex. When we union two vertices, instead of always picking the root of x (or y, it doesn't matter as long as we're consistent) as the new root node, we choose the root node of the vertex with a larger “rank”. We will merge the shorter tree under the taller tree and assign the root node of the taller tree as the root node for both vertices. In this way, we effectively avoid the possibility of connecting all vertices into a straight line. This optimization is called the “disjoint set” with union by rank."],"metadata":{"id":"dxyEbaAcFkgy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class DisjointSets:\n","  def __init__(self, size):\n","    self.root = [i for i in range(size)]\n","    self.rank = [1] * size\n","\n","  def find(self, x):  # O(log N)\n","    while x != self.root[x]:\n","      x = self.root[x]\n","    return x\n","  \n","  def connected(self, x, y):  # O(log N)\n","    return self.find(x) == self.find(y)\n","\n","  def union(self, x, y):  # O(log N)\n","    root_x = self.find(x)\n","    root_y = self.find(y)\n","    if root_x != root_y:\n","      if self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y]:\n","        self.root[root_y] = root_x\n","      elif self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y]:\n","        self.root[root_x] = root_y\n","      else:  # x and y have the same rank\n","        self.root[root_y] = root_x\n","        self.rank[root_x] += 1"],"metadata":{"id":"BKvZb6DIC7Nw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Test Case\n","ds = DisjointSets(10)\n","# 1-2-5-6-7 3-8-9 4\n","ds.union(1, 2)\n","ds.union(2, 5)\n","ds.union(5, 6)\n","ds.union(6, 7)\n","ds.union(3, 8)\n","ds.union(8, 9)\n","print(ds.connected(1, 5))  # true\n","print(ds.connected(5, 7))  # true\n","print(ds.connected(4, 9))  # false\n","# 1-2-5-6-7 3-8-9-4\n","ds.union(9, 4)\n","print(ds.connected(4, 9))  # true"],"metadata":{"id":"r4ubJcVZC96o"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Path compression"],"metadata":{"id":"JymOg9b4FIow"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the previous implementation of the “disjoint set”, notice that to find the root node, we need to traverse the parent nodes sequentially until we reach the root node. If we search the root node of the same element again, we repeat the same operations. Is there any way to optimize this process?\n","\n","The answer is yes! After finding the root node, we can update the parent node of all traversed elements to their root node. When we search for the root node of the same element again, we only need to traverse two elements to find its root node, which is highly efficient. So, how could we efficiently update the parent nodes of all traversed elements to the root node? The answer is to use “recursion”.
